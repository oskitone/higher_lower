:::note
Take your time and make sure the switches are perfectly flat against the PCB before soldering all of their pins.

## Steps

1. Solder SPST switches to **SW2** and **SW3**.

   Make sure they're absolutely flat against the PCB before soldering all of their pins.

## Test

With board powered, pressing either **SW2** or **SW3** plays more tones out of the speaker and flashes **D1**.
