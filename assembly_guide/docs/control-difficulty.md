:::note
Take your time and make sure the switches are perfectly flat against the PCB before soldering all of their pins.

## Steps

1. Solder trimpot **RV1** (10k, marked "103")
   - Again, make sure **RV1** is pushed all the way into PCB before fully soldering.

## Test

Changing **RV1**'s value _before powering the board_ changes the game's difficulty. Try different rotations and count the number of intro beeps before the theme song plays.

More beeps = harder difficulty!
