## Steps

1. Solder trimpot **RV1** (10k, marked "103")
   [![rv1](/img/rv1-021.jpg)](/img/rv1-021.jpg)
   Make sure it's pushed all the way into PCB before fully soldering.

## Test

Changing **RV1**'s value _before powering the board_ changes the game's difficulty. Try different rotations and count the number of intro beeps before the theme song plays.

More beeps = harder game!

Not working as expected? Check the [PCB troubleshooting](pcb-troubleshooting.md) section. Otherwise, continue to the next step.
