You're almost done! Take your time to follow the directions in order.

And check out the [Assembly troubleshooting](assembly-troubleshooting.md) section if you run into any trouble.

## Steps

### 1. Snap enclosure together

Align **enclosure top** onto **enclosure bottom** and snap the two halves together. Try to make sure the **keys mount rail** and **keys** stay aligned as you do this. It's an intentionally tight fit; be brave!

### 2. Quick test

With the **enclosure** together, try turning the Scout on and pressing each key.

You should find that:

1. No notes are playing unless you intentionally press them.
2. Some notes are kind of finicky and require more pressure. Don't worry, we'll fix those in a second!

If not, [pop the enclosure open](opening-the-enclosure.md) and revisit adding the keys in the [Assemble Top](assemble-top.md) step.

## All done!

### Feedback

When you can, please [let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it went for you:

- **What did you like?** Did you have fun?!
- Not including printing time, about **how long did it take?**
- **How'd the kit show up?** Were there any parts missing or damaged? Or any **problems with the instructions**?
- The Scout is intentionally simple, but that doesn't mean future kits will be too. Any **feature requests** for the next Oskitone instrument?

I act and rely on customers' feedback to make the next products even better. Even just knowing that you got it done successfully is valuable feedback, so I do want to hear from you. Thank you so much!

### Share your make

Like your Scout? I'd love to have you share that!

- If you 3D-printed it at home, share your make on the [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4933700) or [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/76472-scout-synth) page where you downloaded the models. It's a good signal to other potential makers to see successful makes.
- Tell your friends, post on social, etc. You know the deal!

### Further reading

For the curious, I've written [a blog post where you can read more about the Scout's development and history](https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/scout/).

Each Oskitone product gets it's own blog post, so dig around in there and see if there's anything else you find interesting.
