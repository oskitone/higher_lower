## Steps

1. Insert the **lightpipe** (1/8" length of standard 1/4" diameter hot glue stick) into its cavity on the **enclosure top**.
2. Insert PCB into the **enclosure bottom**, nestled into its posts.
3. Insert **battery holder** into its hitch on the **enclosure bottom**.
4. Pop **speaker** into place on the **enclosure top**.
5. Place the **switch clutch** into the **enclosure bottom** onto **SW1**'s actuator, along the left edge of PCB.
6. Pop the **button rocker** into its cavity on the **enclosure top**. Its fixture is intentionally a little loose and that's okay.
7. Snap enclosure top and bottom together.

Slide the **switch clutch** to turn the power on and check that the **button rocker** isn't unintentionally holding either of its switches down.

If that works, you're all done!

## Assembly troubleshooting

- Enclosure halves don't fit together well? [Pop the enclosure open](opening-the-enclosure.md) and check...
  - Are any wires in the way?
  - Is the rocker all the way into its fixture?
  - A gap near the lightpipe could mean the lightpipe is too long or isn't in all the way. Push it in, trim the excess, etc.
- Other oddities
  - Is the PCB functioning as expected? If not, go back through the soldering instructions and verify each step's test passes.
  - Something else? [Ask](https://www.oskitone.com/contact)!

## What's next

### Feedback

When you can, please [let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it went for you:

- **What did you like?** Did you have fun?!
- Not including printing time, about **how long did it take?**
- **How'd the kit show up?** Were there any parts missing or damaged? Or any **problems with the instructions**?

I act and rely on customers' feedback to make the next products even better. Even just knowing that you got it done successfully is valuable feedback, so I do want to hear from you. Thank you so much!

### Share your make

Like Higher Lower? I'd love to have you share that!

TODO: links

- If you 3D-printed it at home, share your make on the [Thingiverse](TODO) or [PrusaPrinters](TODO) page where you downloaded the models. It's a good signal to other potential makers to see successful makes.
- Tell your friends, post on social, etc. You know the deal!
