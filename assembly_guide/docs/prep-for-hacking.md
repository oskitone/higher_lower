:::note
If you have no intention of ever changing the game's code, you can skip this part and it will work perfectly fine. But, you know, you're here, so you might as well!

## Steps

1. Solder **J1** header.
   - Try to get it flat against PCB, as usual. Here, I'm using some tape to hold in in place.

## <del>Test</del> All done?!

This one is harder to test, but if you've got it soldered and all the previous steps' tests passed, you're good to go!

:::note No but really
J1 is a header that connects to a programmer, letting you upload new code to the microcontroller. Code and basic usage are described in the [project's github repo](https://github.com/oskitone/higher_lower). It's a bit advanced, so, for now, I've left it out of the assembly guide.

Please [_email_ me to let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it goes or if you need any help.
