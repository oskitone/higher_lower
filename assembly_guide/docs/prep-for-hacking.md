:::note
If you have no intention of ever changing the game's code, you can skip this part and it will work perfectly fine. But, you know, you're here, so you might as well!

## Steps

1. Solder **J1** header.
   - Try to get it flat against PCB, as usual...

## Test

Code and basic programming are described in the [project's github repo](https://github.com/oskitone/higher_lower). Please [please _email_ me to let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it goes or if you need any help. I'll use your feedback to improve this guide.
