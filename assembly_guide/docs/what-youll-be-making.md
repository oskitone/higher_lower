## What you'll be making

This guide walks you through how to solder and assemble it, step by step. It will take 30 minutes or so, not counting 3D-printing time.

### How to play "Higher Lower"

Two different tones play. Is the second tone _higher_ or _lower_ than the first? The more guesses you get right, the harder it gets!

- Four guesses per round, ten rounds per game. Any wrong guess and the game resets.
- Your score is how many rounds have passed, and it's announced after each round as a series of happy trill noises.
- For a multiplayer game, hand off to the next player after each round. The last player to successfully complete their round wins.
- At the start of each new game, the "Higher Lower" theme song plays. It is a very good song.
- Upon completing all ten rounds of guesses and winning the game, the theme plays again, faster and _faster_ and **_faster_** until the machine finally resets into a new game at a harder difficulty setting.
- Adjust volume and game difficulty by opening the enclosure and adjusting trim potentiometers on the PCB.
