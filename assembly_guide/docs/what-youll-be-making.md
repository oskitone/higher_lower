## What You'll Be Making

Higher Lower is a 3D-printed, screen-free, handheld electronic game about arbitrary musical intervals.

> Two tones play. Is the second one higher or lower than the first? The more guesses you get right, the harder it gets!

Four guesses per round, ten rounds per game. Any wrong guess and the game resets.
